<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The NASA-Sloan Atlas sample was selected to include virtually all
known redshifts out to about <var>z&lt;0.05</var> for galaxies with in
the coverage of <a href="http://sdss3.org/dr8">SDSS DR8</a>. For each
such galaxy, we have created image mosaics from SDSS and GALEX and
rephotometered the <var>ugriz</var> bands plus the far and near
ultraviolet bands in a self-consistent manner. After cleaning a
number of suspicious cases the final catalog contains about 140,000
galaxies.</p>
<p> This catalog is meant to represent an improvement on the standard
pipeline catalogs from either survey. In particular, the SDSS standard
pipeline oversubtracts the sky for large objects, whereas our analysis
avoids that issue.  However, there are still existing errors that
users should watch out for, listed in our <a href="caveats">caveats</a>.</p>
<h2 id="catalogs">Source catalogs</h2>
<p>The list of galaxies in the NSA was generated on the basis of
several catalogs: <a href="http://www.sdss3.org/dr8">Sloan Digital Sky
Server DR8</a>, <a href="http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/">NASA
Extragalactic Database</a>, <a href="http://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/6df/">Six-degree Field Galaxy
Redshift Survey</a>, <a href="http://msowww.anu.edu.au/2dFGRS/">Two-degree Field Galaxy
Redshift Survey</a>, <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~dfabricant/huchra/zcat/">ZCAT</a>
and <a href="http://egg.astro.cornell.edu/index.php">ALFALFA</a> In
each case we restricted the sample to galaxies with heliocentric
redshifts less than 0.055 and did our best to exclude stars
misclassified as galaxies.  We combined the source lists and removed
duplicates.  In addition, we determined the SDSS coverage of each
galaxy and kept only those within the SDSS imaging survey.</p>
<p>Each galaxy is given a unique integer (NSAID) based on its position
in this original catalog, which we use to label each galaxy. Together
with the NSA version (e.g. v0_1_0) the NSAID uniquely identifies each
galaxy. (Note that some galaxies are removed due to problems
identified in the analysis).</p>
<h2 id="sdss">SDSS images</h2>
<p>The SDSS mosaics used here are produced using the sky-subtraction
techniques described in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142...31B">Blanton et
al. (2011)</a>. They correspond to the data in Data Release 8. These
have been shown to be typically well enough sky-subtracted to handle
galaxies with half-light radii of over an arcminute. </p>
<p>The sizes of the images were determined based on the estimated
sizes and/or magnitudes of the objects from the source
catalogs. Occasionally these have proven too small, causing problems
with the derived photometry.</p>
<h2 id="galex">GALEX images</h2>
<p>The GALEX mosaics used here were produced by David Schiminovich
based on GR6 data.  Some of the images do not extend as far as the
SDSS images do, but in virtually all cases they include all of the
intended object. They have been sky-subtracted using the standard sky
subtraction from the GALEX pipeline.</p>
<h2 id="distance">Distances</h2>
<p> For each object within 6,400 km/s we provide an estimate of its
distance corrected for peculiar velocities. We perform the correction
using the beta=0.5 linear prediction based on the IRAS 1.2 Jy redshift
survey density field (Willick et al. 1997). </p>
<p> The results are stored in the columns of the master catalog:</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>ZDIST</b>: redshift corrected for peculiar velocity, in the
Local Group frame of reference</li>
<li> <b>ZDIST_ERR</b>: estimated error on redshift (assumes velocity
dispersion of 150 km/s)</li>
<li> <b>ZLG</b>: redshift in Local Group frame, uncorrected for
peculiar velocities</li>
</ul>
<p>For objects outside of 6,400 km/s, <b>ZDIST</b> is simply equal to
<b>ZLG</b>. For objects inside, it is the distance which maximizes the
likelihood of observing that object under the model from Willick et al
(1997).</p>
<p>Note that for very nearby objects there are available direct
distance estimates; we have not attempted to incorporate those
here.</p>
<h2 id="photo">Photometric analysis</h2>
<p>The photometric analysis uses the detection and deblending
technique described in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142...31B">Blanton et
al. (2011)</a>, which is based in spirit on the SDSS photometric
pipeline of <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ASPC..238..269L">Lupton et
al. (2001)</a>. We first determine which pixels in each mosaic are
detected in the <var>r</var> band image. Each island of contiguous
detected pixels defines the "parent" object.  Within each parent, we
deblend into several different "child" objects. The primary
differences between our algorithm here and that of the standard SDSS
pipeline are: (a) we use constant templates based on the <var>r</var>
band image; and (b) we require much higher significance to deblend a
child as a galaxy rather than a star. These differences make our
implementation more stable for the largest galaxies.</p>
<p>For the child objects, we measure them using some of the standard
techniques employed by SDSS. We measure their azimuthally-averaged
profiles and calculate circular Petrosian quantities using the SDSS
parameters (PETROFLUX in the catalog). In addition, we calculate
Stokes parameters, which yield second-order axis ratios and position
angles. Other parameters measured are listed in the data model.</p>
<p>The most robust measurements come from the Sersic fits, which are
one-component, two-dimensional fits that yield a Sersic index,
half-light radius, position angle, axis ratio and flux.  We correct
these fluxes to the AB system and calculate absolute magnitudes using
the routines in the <a href="http://howdy.physics.nyu.edu/index.php/Kcorrect">kcorrect</a>
package (v4_2). The inverse variances for each absolute magnitude are
listed; these include estimated distance uncertainties. Note in some
cases some bands (particularly far- and near-UV) are missing; for such
objects the corresponding inverse variances are set to zero.</p>
<p>After the analysis, the results are inspected to remove catalog
entries that turned out to be stars, which there are some of, and
remaining duplicates. The latter can occur when there are several SDSS
spectra (for example) off-center from the galaxy. </p>
<h2 id="sdss_spectro">SDSS spectroscopy</h2>
<p>Renbin Yan has remeasured the SDSS spectra using an improved
calibration, which affects the small equivalent width lines. We list
the results of these measurements in the catalog as well. They include
a number of the standard spectroscopic line measurements and
absorption line measurements. </p>
