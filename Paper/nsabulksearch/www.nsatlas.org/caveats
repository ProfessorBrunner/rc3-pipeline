<p>The NASA-Sloan Atlas is brand new, and should be used with
caution. In general, for galaxies with suspicious or unusual catalog
parameters, or which are very bright, it is worth using the NSAID to
look them up in our <a href="search">search form</a> to determine
whether there are comments about them or obvious problems in the
images.  A good rule of thumb is that most NGC or UGC objects are
fine, but most Messier objects are not.</p>
<p>More particularly:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>i and z band sky fluctuations</b>: The sky subtraction method
used leaves some low surface brightness galaxies sensitive to sky
subtraction issues.  About 5% of the sky area of SDSS has <var>i</var>
and <var>z</var> band sky variations that our sky subtraction does not
track well.  This affects galaxies of low surface brightness
(Î¼<sub>50</sub>&gt;22.5), sometimes substantially affecting their
red colors.</li>
<li><b>Deblending issues</b>: Although in general the data is better
than the SDSS photometry, there are known to still be some deblending
problems in the NSA.  In particular, near bright stars and galaxies
there are still errors. For the largest galaxies, particularly those
brighter than <var>r</var>&lt;12, deblending can substantially affect
the flux.</li>
<li><b>Astrometric errors</b>: At declinations above 41 deg, there can
be small astrometric errors in the mosaics and catalog positions, up
to about a 0.25 arcsec shift. The nature of these errors are described
in the <a href="http://www.sdss3.org/dr8/algorithms/astrometry.php#caveats">SDSS
DR8</a> documentation.</li>
<li><b>Distances</b>: The distances and absolute magnitudes are based
on the velocity model of Willick et al. 1997. In general, this can
differ from other estimates, and in particular we have not included
direct distance estimates for the nearest objects.</li>
<li><b>GALEX fluxes</b>: For larger objects, the GALEX fluxes are
underestimated by about 0.3 mag relative to Gil de Paz et al. (2009).
We are working on evaluating the nature of that discrepancy.</li>
<li><b>Matching to SDSS spectroscopy</b>: The SDSS spectroscopy is
used as a source catalog for redshifts in generating the NSA.
Sometimes these spectra are "off-center" as determined in our
photometric analysis. Therefore, we have separately matched the final
measured centers to the SDSS spectroscopy.  In cases selected from the
SDSS catalog but for which there is no SDSS spectrum at the galaxy
center, the redshifts listed are from the off-center spectrum, and we
list no other spectroscopic measurements.  If there is an SDSS
spectrum at the galaxy center, the redshift from that spectrum is
used, and we list the spectroscopic measurements from Yan et
al. (2011). In this manner, except for redshifts, we have only listed
spectroscopic measurements for galaxy centers, not for off-center
spectra.</li>
