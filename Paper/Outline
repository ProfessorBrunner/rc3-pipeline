- Abstract

- Intro
	- (Discuss Previous work in literature)
		- RC3 (Corwin)
		- EFIGI catalog 
			- http://www.astromatic.net/projects/efigi
			- Using DR4 Data
		- RC3 Mosaics (Hogg, Blanton)
			- http://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/rc3/
			- SDSS DR6 Data
		- We use DR10 data, Also provide a Way so that when there is new data it could just be fit into the pipelineAnd obtainResultsWith Minimal extra work needed to be done to each survey

	- how this Information would be useful forOther astronomers  (?)
		- Target selection In surveys
			- maybe people want to study Galaxy With particular Characteristics that coincide with RC3 selection criteria (galaxies smaller than 1 arcmin, fainter than 15.5...etc  )so RC3 galaxies is a subset of the sample that their studying 
		- Convenient way of grabbing big large nearby galaxies

- Algorithm
	- Talk briefly about difficulty with positional inaccuracy of original RC3 
		- Mosaic galaxy and off center or can not found
		- we figured out that this was not due to wrong coordinate frame converison/ equinox precession issue J2000 ==>B2000, This issue does existBut the effects should be negligible in terms of Mosaicing
		- Two different levels of precision shown in RC3:  HH MM.m, DD MM for 
the inaccurately known positions(Accuracy of 1-2 arcmin), and HH MM SS.s, DD MM SS for the more 
accurately known positions (Accuracy of 5-8 arcsec)
	- Main idea behind recursive program
		- use the mosaics to find the new updated center then use the 
updated center to recenter the mosaic. In doing so, we end up with a new re-calibration set of positions 
for the RC3 catalog and a large set of images of RC3  galaxies that lies in the SDSS footprint
	- Discuss steps in source_info:
		1) mosaic r fits file first as "test" to figure out margin ==> speed up computing time
			- "unclean" obj not filtered out but labelled.
		2) SExtractor to find object
			- keep only objects that are greater than RC3 threshold
			- Radius definition (Pythagorean method), flux_radius
		If Object found,
		3) Resolving Source Confusion: other RC3 that lies in the field
			- assume no distortion : "shift vector" Same for all objects in the field
			- Cross correlate catalog of image objects
		4) Montage mosaic all band 
		Object not found => recursion.
			- margin increase factor of 1.5
	- Imaging parameters
		- Need To look more into this (Not even done very well in SDSS run)
		- Color image that emphasize on low surface structure versus High background cut images
	
	
- Pipeline
	- Motivation: update  positional values and make mosaic FITS.
	- Reasoning behind Class Hieracrcbhy Structure
		- Discuss how the existing framework can be expanded to other catalog 
		- How using other surveys could improve coverage of a catalog
		- Discuss possibility of multiband imaging From different surveys
		
		
- Results from SDSS run
	- Stats that we would have after the run: 
		- # of RC3 galaxies outside of footprint
		- List of Improved positional values
		- List of a few galaxies that can't be found at all within 3 iterations
		
- Appendix: Code and Data product 
	- Brief mention of where to find code and how they can be used
		- Serve Code on Git
		- IPython documentation and Tutorial
		- Serve Resulting SDSS data off LCDM Website
			- Simple search database(?)
