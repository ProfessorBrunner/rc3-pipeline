Misc. stuff to note
- Should empty sections be used for paper organization?
	- For example in Section 3, nothing is inside Algorithm and Pipeline, only in subsubsections:
		- Algorithm
			- Position Update
			- Source Confusion
		- Pipeline
			- Server 
			- Catalog Object
			- Catalog
- Fig4 UML, words kind of squished,  goes in appendix? 
- Flowchart Image for algorithms : no caption is necessary ==> wasted space if made into figure?
- Use consistent spelling: mosaicking
- How to cite tools  that I don't use very often or refer to API extensions to pipeline (ex. APLPy, Aladin,NED)?
	- simply footnote with project page url (footnote may get long), or cite their respective product release paper (no additional info was actually obtained from the paper)? 
- Add Acknowledgement for your NSF grant thing?
- (?)citation style is elsarticle-harv
    - no longer using citet
- add in DSS run information once it finishes running (query the .db)
