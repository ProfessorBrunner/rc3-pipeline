Questions
- Should empty sections be used for paper organization?
	- For example in Section 3, nothing is inside Algorithm and Pipeline, only in subsubsections:
		- Algorithm
			- Position Update
			- Source Confusion
		- Pipeline
			- Server 
			- Catalog Object
			- Catalog
- Fig4 UML, words kind of squished,  goes in appendix? 
- Flowchart Image for algorithms : no caption is necessary ==> wasted space if made into figure?
- How to cite tools  that I don't use very often or refer to APIs as extensions to pipeline (ex. APLPy, Aladin,NED)?
	- simply footnote with project page url (footnote may get long), or cite their respective product release paper (no additional info was actually obtained from the paper)? 
- Will add in DSS run information once it finishes running (by querying the db)



Resolved Issues
- Citation for this journal is done by (Greisen, 2003)
	- use setcitestyle to prevent clashing 
	- to remove the square bracket in year use \citealp instead
- Use consistent spelling: mosaicking
- modified Fig 2 so that markers are more easily seen
- tried fitting necessary figures/tables into single column
